# Unminify picoCTF Write-Up

## Challenge Description
I don't like scrolling down to read the code of my website, so I've squished it. As a bonus, my pages load faster!

## Solution Steps

- Open the provided website and view the page source.
- The HTML is minified, making it hard to read at a glance.
- Carefully inspect the HTML and look for the flag.
- The flag is embedded directly in a `<p>` tag:
  ```
  <p class="picoCTF{pr3tty_c0d3_ed938a7e}"></p>
  ```
- The flag is: `picoCTF{pr3tty_c0d3_ed938a7e}`

## Flag
```
picoCTF{pr3tty_c0d3_ed938a7e}
```
