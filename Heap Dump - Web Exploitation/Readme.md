# heap-dump picoCTF Write-Up

## Challenge Description
Welcome to the challenge! In this challenge, you will explore a web application and find an endpoint that exposes a file containing a hidden flag.  
The application is a simple blog website where you can read articles about various topics, including an article about API Documentation. Your goal is to explore the application and find the endpoint that generates files holding the serverâ€™s memory, where a secret flag is hidden.

## Solution Steps

1. **Explore the Website and View Source Code**  
   Start by browsing the blog website and viewing the page source. In the HTML, you will find an endpoint:
   ```html
   <a href="/api-docs" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">
   ```
   This link leads to the API documentation.

2. **Find the Heap Dump Endpoint**  
   On the `/api-docs` page, you will see information about a diagnostic endpoint `/heapdump` that accepts GET requests.

3. **Download the Heap Dump File**  
   Access the heap dump endpoint:
   ```
   http://verbal-sleep.picoctf.net:49649/heapdump
   ```
   This will download a file named similar to `heapdump-1755156161848.heapsnapshot`.

4. **Search for the Flag in the Heap Dump**  
   Open the downloaded file with a text editor such as Notepad. Search for the keyword `picoCTF` and you will find the flag:
   ```
   picoCTF{Pat!3nt_15_Th3_K3y_f1179e46}
   ```

## Flag
```
picoCTF{Pat!3nt_15_Th3_K3y_f1179e46}
```
