# Includes picoCTF Write-Up

## Challenge Description
This challenge presents a website with a button that, when clicked, triggers a popup message stating: "This code is in a separate file!". The goal is to investigate the website and retrieve the hidden flag.

## Solution Steps

1. **Analyze the Page Source Code**  
   Inspecting the source code, we find the following relevant HTML snippet:
   ```html
   <script src="script.js"></script>
   ```
   This indicates that JavaScript code is loaded from an external file named `script.js`.

2. **Inspect Browser Developer Tools**  
   Open the developer console (F12 in most browsers) and navigate to the **Sources** tab. Here, we see two external files:
   - `script.js` (contains JavaScript functionality)
   - `style.css` (contains styling information)

3. **Examine `script.js` for Clues**  
   Checking the content of `script.js`, we find a comment:
   ```
   f7w_2of2_b8f4b022}
   ```
   This looks like part of the flag.

4. **Examine `style.css` for Additional Information**  
   In `style.css`, another comment is found:
   ```
   picoCTF{1nclu51v17y_1of2_
   ```
   This appears to be the first part of the flag.

5. **Combine Both Parts to Form the Flag**  
   From `style.css`: `picoCTF{1nclu51v17y_1of2_`
   From `script.js`: `f7w_2of2_b8f4b022}`
   
   Merging both parts gives the complete flag:
   ```
   picoCTF{1nclu51v17y_1of2_f7w_2of2_b8f4b022}
   ```

## Flag
```
picoCTF{1nclu51v17y_1of2_f7w_2of2_b8f4b022}
```
