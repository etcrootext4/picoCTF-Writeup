## Challenge Description
Welcome to the **Scavenger Hunt** challenge! Your task is to find all parts of the flag hidden in various files on a web server.

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### **Part 1: HTML Comment in `index.html`**
Start by checking the main page's source code. Right-click on the page and select *View Page Source*.

**Discovered in `index.html`:**
```html
<!-- Here's the first part of the flag: picoCTF{t -->
```

**Part 1:** `picoCTF{t`

---

### **Part 2: CSS File `style.css`**
Next, inspect the linked CSS file. Sometimes, hints are hidden in comments there.

**Discovered in `style.css`:**
```css
/* CSS makes the page look nice, and yes, it also has part of the flag. Here's part 2: h4ts_4_l0 */
```

**Part 2:** `h4ts_4_l0`

### **Part 3: `robots.txt`**
A clue from the JavaScript file suggests checking how to prevent Google from indexing pages. This typically points to `robots.txt`.

**Discovered in `robots.txt`:**
```plaintext
User-agent: *
Disallow: /index.html

# Part 3: t_0f_pl4c
# I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag?
```

**Part 3:** `t_0f_pl4c`

### **Part 4: `.htaccess`**
The previous hint mentions Apache servers. On such servers, `.htaccess` often controls access settings. Checking this file reveals:

**Discovered in `.htaccess`:**
```plaintext
# Part 4: 3s_2_lO0k
# I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there.
```

**Part 4:** `3s_2_lO0k`

### **Part 5: `.DS_Store`**
The `.DS_Store` file is a macOS-generated file that can unintentionally expose directory structures. Downloading and analyzing this file provides the final part:

**Discovered in `.DS_Store`:**
```plaintext
Congrats! You completed the scavenger hunt. Part 5: _a69684fd}
```

**Part 5:** `_a69684fd}`

## **Flag**
By combining all parts in order:

```
picoCTF{t + h4ts_4_l0 + t_0f_pl4c + 3s_2_lO0k + _a69684fd}
```

 **Final Flag:**
```
picoCTF{th4ts_4_l0t_0f_pl4c3s_2_lO0k_a69684fd}
```
